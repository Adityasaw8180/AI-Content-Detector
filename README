AI Content Detector – Mini Project 3

A Web Application for AI vs Human Authorship Verification

This project is a web application built using ReactJS (frontend) and Python (backend). It detects whether a given text/prompt is authored by a human or generated by an AI model.
The application was designed to participate in the Voight-Kampff Generative AI Authorship Verification 2024 challenge.

🚀 Features

AI vs Human Detection – Classifies input text as human-written or AI-generated.

Machine Learning Models – Uses pre-trained language models for classification.

ReactJS Frontend – Simple, interactive, and user-friendly interface.

Python Backend – Flask-based backend for text processing and AI detection.

Evaluation Metrics – Uses Perplexity and Burstiness for decision-making.

📦 Modules & Libraries
🔹 Backend (Python)

Flask – Lightweight web framework for API endpoints.

Flask-CORS – Enables cross-origin requests from the frontend.

PyTorch – For running deep learning computations.

Transformers (Hugging Face) – Loads GPT-2 (GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2TokenizerFast) for text analysis.

Regular Expressions (re) – Cleans and preprocesses text.

OrderedDict – Maintains ordered results for easier interpretation.

🔹 Frontend (ReactJS)

React + npm packages for UI.

Axios (or Fetch API) for making API requests to backend.

⚙️ Algorithm & Workflow

The detection logic relies on Perplexity and Burstiness computed using GPT-2:

Perplexity (PPL):

Measures how well the model predicts text.

Lower PPL → Text is more predictable → Likely AI.

Higher PPL → Text is less predictable → Likely human.

Burstiness:

Measures variation in PPL across sentences.

High variation → Indicates AI-like patterns.

Thresholding for Decision:

PPL < 60 → AI-generated

60 ≤ PPL < 80 → Most likely AI (needs more text)

PPL ≥ 80 → Human-written

API Endpoint:

POST / → Accepts JSON { "text": "..." }

Returns { "label": "AI-generated/Human-written", "perplexity": ..., "burstiness": ... }

🎯 Use Cases

Content Authenticity Verification – Check if an article/blog/essay is original.

Education – Detect AI usage in student submissions.

Content Moderation – Flag AI-generated posts in forums/social media.

🛠️ Installation
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/AkashKobal/Generative-AI-Detection.git
cd Generative-AI-Detection

2. Install Frontend Dependencies
cd frontend
npm install

3. Install Backend Dependencies
cd ../server
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Start Backend Server
python app.py

5. Start Frontend Server
npm start

💻 Usage

Open browser → http://localhost:3000

Enter/upload text (human-written or AI-generated).

Click Analyse → View classification results.

📂 Data

Dataset includes both human-written and AI-generated texts.

Each text is processed to compute:

Perplexity

Burstiness

Used to decide authorship classification.

📊 Evaluation Metrics

Perplexity (PPL):

Low → More predictable → AI-like.

High → More diverse → Human-like.

Burstiness:

High → Indicates unusual variance → AI.

Low → Consistent → Human.
